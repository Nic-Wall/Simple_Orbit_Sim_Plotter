Orbit Sim Plotter
Continuing to explore my interests in satellites, while integrating geometry into programming, I created the following basic orbit visualizer.
When run the script uses matplotlib to generate a planet (blue semi-transparent sphere), a number of satellite orbits (red 2D circles with a randomly generated orientation around the planet), a satellite per orbit (randomly generated point on each orbit), and four lines originating from each point indicating the spherical cap visible to the satellite of the planet below.
An example of the script and it's outcome can be found below...
